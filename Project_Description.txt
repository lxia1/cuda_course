The game board is a 6x7 grid stored as a 2D array where 0 represents an empty cell, 1 represents Player 1’s moves, and 2 represents Player 2’s moves.

Each player is represented by a separate GPU (GPU 0 for Player 1, GPU 1 for Player 2). The game logic uses CUDA to make moves in parallel:

A CUDA kernel randomly selects a column for a player’s move and places the token in the lowest available row. Moves are only valid if there is space in the selected column. 

After each move, the board is synchronized between the two GPUs.

The game alternates between players, and after each move, the board is printed to the console. The game continues until one player wins, and the program halts.
